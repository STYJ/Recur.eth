Considerations
- What if I tried to DCA and it failed? Solution: Monitor price on Kyber before you broadcast and you only take gas from enduser if the trade passes
- if min block order is too low, I have to limit how frequent I check or I will self ddos my server.
- Only trigger trade if current gas price is < maxGasPrice because we can only deduct at most maxGasPrice from user.
- If I let users specify minConversionRate, it is more flexibility for the user but it also means that there is a higher chance that if I trigger order, the trade will fail
- Think we can just do token to token (use WETH) because it makes the contract easier to read.

To Do
- Split token to token trades into 2. Deduct gas from the ETH component. (done for actual swap function, mock function dont have yet)
- add require statement for checking srcToken != ETH address instead of using if statement? <- add when creating / updating order
- Create OrderManagerStorage contract
- add comments to all functions

others
- add min conversion rate to order? <- checks that rate is better than minConversionRate or it wont trigger.

functions
- createOrder
cannot create order if any conditions fail - done
can create - done
is added in sc correctly - done


- trigger trade
cannot trigger if any condition fail - done 
            re/de activate order - done
                only owner can do - done
                sc updated correctly - done
can trigger if all conditions pass - done
            order updated accordingly when trade is completed - done

order updated correctly - done


gas stored

- update order
only owner can update - done
cannot update order if any conditions fail - done
can update - done 
is updated in sc correctly - done



- calculate average gas
test it out
