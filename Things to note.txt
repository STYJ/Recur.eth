Considerations
- What if I tried to DCA and it failed? Solution: Monitor price on Kyber before you broadcast and you only take gas from enduser if the trade passes
- if min block order is too low, I have to limit how frequent I check or I will self ddos my server.
- Only trigger trade if current gas price is < maxGasPrice because we can only deduct at most maxGasPrice from user.

ToDo
- Split token to token trades into 2. Deduct gas from the ETH component. 
- Create OrderManagerStorage contract
- function to change KNP address.
- add min conversion rate to order? <- checks that rate is better than minConversionRate or it wont trigger.
- create checklist of tasks to do.
