Considerations
- What if I tried to DCA and it failed? Solution: Monitor price on Kyber before you broadcast and you only take gas from enduser if the trade passes

Extensions
- Replace tokenToEth and ethToToken with mock trade functions. Just return an equal amount of Eth or tokens back.
- Need function to calculate gas
- Split token to token trades into 2. Deduct gas from the ETH component. 
- Give some tokens and ETH to oml contract
- Create OrderManagerStorage contract
