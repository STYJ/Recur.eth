Considerations
- What if I tried to DCA and it failed? Solution: Monitor price on Kyber before you broadcast and you only take gas from enduser if the trade passes
- if min block order is too low, can ddos server since i have to keep querying

ToDo
- need to add test to check that variables actually decrease after trade was taken.
- need to add test to check that trades cannot happen if minTradesLeft is 0
- Split token to token trades into 2. Deduct gas from the ETH component. 
- Create OrderManagerStorage contract
- function to change KNP address.
- create checklist of tasks to do.
